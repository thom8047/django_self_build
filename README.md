# django_self_build

## DESCRIPTION

Building web-site for Amy. More testing and manipulation than actual design building for specific reason.

## SPECIFIC FEATURES [UPDATED]

Got CSS file and JavaScript file implemented. Got nav menu, and side-nav-menu, Got SQLite as database and got posts with post information.

### WANT UPDATES FOR:

Get base template working. Update so I can manipulate base template and create new templates for site.

Get PostgreSQL (POSSIBLY), may leave for new project.

Get More styling involved.

Ask amy what features are wanted.

## ISSUES

### NON-SERIOUS

The nav menu has login/sign-up that moves when side-nav is opened. Figure how to not move.
